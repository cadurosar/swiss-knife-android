# swiss-knife-android
After downloading the repository, either by using the GIT tool\footnote{https://git-scm.com/} or the direct download url \url{https://codeload.github.com/cadurosar/swiss-knife-android/zip/master} you can see that the main directory is divided in 2 folders, "Custom" and "Apps". Custom refers to the \modecm\ implementations and is separated in two sub-folders Reader and Tag, inside each sub-folder there is a file called install.sh that will download the Android source code and install the different drivers needed (it supposes that the phones you are going to install into were the same used in our implementation, if you want to use this code in models that differ from our implementation you are going to have to change the installation file), this process may take several hours. There's also 2 other folders called "Code" and "Others, the former contains all the code that we modified/added for this version; while the latter contains utility scripts (e.g. compilation and flashing for example), a manual file explaining how to choose which version, compile and install the modified operational system in your android smartphone, and also a file showing all the differences between the pure Android code for the version and our modifications.

For the applications and also the \modenl\ the folder Apps is divided in two sub-folders, "Tag" and "Reader", referent to which entity is implemented by the app. Then for each entity we have two sub-folders, one for which implementation (8-bit and 1-bit version). In each version folder we have a file named "app-debug.apk", the compiled version of our application, and a folder that contains an Android Studio project containing the code of our application.
